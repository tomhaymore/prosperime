In the current market, where energy costs are on the rise and expected to keep climbing, having a fixed rate for your energy bill provides both savings and peace of mind. \r\n\r\nSince its inception, Solmentum has provided this peace of mind to more than 1,000 happy homeowners in the form of over 5MW of electricity.

FSC will also consider tenants with an S&P stock rating of A or better, and from time to time non investment grade tenants and double-net (NN) transactions.

That\u2019s no longer the case, as fund sizes routinely pass $500 million and a few even top $1 billion.

For example, if a business raises a small amount of initial capital, then exceeds its early milestones and decides to swing for the fences, it can then raise a larger sum at a higher price, while preserving ownership. If the business is not ready for rapid growth, it preserves the option for an exit at around $50 million, while still delivering a high return for investors.

Drexel's programs are complemented by co-operative education experiences for many of our students, where theory and practice converge.\r\n\r\nA pioneer in co-operative education since 1919, Drexel operates one of the oldest and largest co-operative education programs in the nation. Under the Drexel co-op plan, students attend classes full-time for their entire freshman year. Then, depending on their academic program, they alternate periods of full-time classroom studies and full-time professional employment with University-approved employers. Students can repeat this cycle up to three times, gaining up to 18 months of real-world, professional work experience to complement their diploma.\r\n\r\nDrexel's academic calendar is based on a quarter system; a student's co-op cycle defines which quarters he or she will participate in the co-op experience. For example, students with a fall/winter co-op cycle will work full-time during the fall and winter quarters, while a student with a spring/summer co-op cycle will work full-time during the spring and summer quarters. Co-op cycles are typically assigned during freshman year.\r\n\r\nA few programs in the College of Nursing and Health Professions, School of Public Health, and Drexel University College of Medicine operate on the semester system.

Others provide funding for research centers, instruments and facilities that allow scientists, engineers and students to work at the outermost frontiers of knowledge.
