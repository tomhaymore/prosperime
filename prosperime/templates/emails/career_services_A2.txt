My name is {{owner}} and I am a recent Stanford University graduate and co-founder of <a href="http://www.prospr.me">ProsperMe</a>. At ProsperMe, we're building tools to help college students explore and think about their careers and career goals.\n\n

Our newest tool is called "What can you do with your major?" and helps students visualize what jobs they can expect depending on their major. The information for this tool comes from the student's own school and alumni network.\n\n

You can check it out at www.prospr.me/majors.\n\n

This tool works best the more people at your school use it. As we said, it's free for universities and students. Would you be willing to share this with your students?\n\n

We'd also love to hear your feedback -- how can we make this better? How could this make your job easier?\n\n

Thanks,\n
Clayton &amp; Thomas\n
Co-Founders @ ProsperMe\n
