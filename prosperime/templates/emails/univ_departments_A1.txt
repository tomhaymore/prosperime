My name is {{owner}}, and I am a recent Stanford graduate and co-founder of ProsperMe. At ProsperMe, we're building tools to help college students explore and think about their careers and career goals.
\n
\n
We've recently launched a free tool that allows students to dynamically visualize the connection between college majors and first jobs within their university network. 
\n
\n
With this visualization, we're attacking of some of the core questions that young people have. 
\n
\n
- What can I do with my major? \n
- What are other people like me doing? \n
\n
\n
Our goal is give yourself and your students more information in an easy-to-use format, not to suggest one particular answer. That way you can more easily advise students and students can see just how many options they have (and draw on the strength of their alumni networks).
\n
\n
Would you be interested in sharing this with your students? You can simply forward the link at www.prospr.me/majors/
\n
\n
We'd love to hear your feedback on how we can make this tool more useful for you.

Thanks,
