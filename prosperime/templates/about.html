				We founded ProsperMe with the goal of helping people live happier, more prosperous lives. As we each found ourselves at a crossroads in our own careers, we realized that there was no tool for people like us to find quantitative, relevant, and personalized information about jobs that we might be interested in. It is our hope that ProsperMe helps you on your way to forging a meaningful career of your own.
