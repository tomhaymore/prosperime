	<p class="feature-page-header">Privacy Policy</p>

	<p class="main-sub-header">What information do we collect?</p>

	<p>We collect information in two ways:

	<p>1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.

	<p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, biographical information, comments, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. 

	<p>You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your LinkedIn account to ProsperMe, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your professional history and contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.

	<p>2. We get technical information when you use our products.

	<p>These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.

	<p>Log Data. When you use ProsperMe, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you use it to access ProsperMe. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to ProsperMe, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used ProsperMe.

	<p>Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your ProsperMe account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other ProsperMe settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit ProsperMe.

	<p>Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using ProsperMe on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.

	<p class="main-sub-header">How do we use the information we collect?</p>

	<p>We use the information we collect to provide our services to you and make them better, develop new services, and protect ProsperMe and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a service, which can help us understand which version is better.

	<p>We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content and tailored advertising.

	<p>The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever ProsperMe does business, including countries outside your own.
